I am an Economist^[needs citation (read PhD)] but this page is mostly about the tools and cool things I come across.

These days I am interested in:

- WebR: Magic that runs R in your Browser.

  - [nice documentation](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/)
  - a demo by ever amazing [DJ Navarro](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-04-09_webr/)
  
- API discovery^[fun fact: I recently scraped 44 million observations using _arrow_, _future_, and plain old _httr_.]
  - a [demo](demo-webR.html) describing how I go about it

- Cool packages to work with Big (ish) data sets:- _[fst](https://www.fstpackage.org/)_, _[arrow](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/arrow.html)_
